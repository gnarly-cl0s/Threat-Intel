This project is a repository to help set up a comprehensive log management and visualization system in a home lab environment. By forwarding PFSense logs to Graylog, you can achieve centralized log management and enhance the data with GeoIP information based on detected Source IPs. The enriched log data is then visualized using Grafana, providing insightful and actionable dashboards to monitor network traffic and security events.
